This tutorial can be used to calibrate industrial cameras which are used to process images with OpenCV.

This way we can transform images from 
![Distortions](https://github.com/Multi-Access-Edge-Computing-Playground/MEC-Sandbox/blob/master/Calibrate_Camera_with_Chessboard/distortion.jpg)

to
![Undistorted](https://github.com/Multi-Access-Edge-Computing-Playground/MEC-Sandbox/blob/master/Calibrate_Camera_with_Chessboard/corrected_img.jpg)

In order to calibrate the intrinsic parameters of a camera and remove fish eye disturbances etc. it is neccessary to do the following steps 

1. print out the [chessboard](https://github.com/Multi-Access-Edge-Computing-Playground/MEC-Sandbox/blob/master/Calibrate_Camera_with_Chessboard/pattern.png) in any size and glue it to a flat surface.
2.
