To calibrate the intrinsic parameters of a camera in order to remove fish eye disturbances etc. it is neccessary to print out a chessboard and glue it to a flat surface

This way we can transform images from 
![Distortions](https://github.com/Multi-Access-Edge-Computing-Playground/MEC-Sandbox/blob/master/Calibrate_Camera_with_Chessboard/distortion.jpg)

to
![Undistorted](https://github.com/Multi-Access-Edge-Computing-Playground/MEC-Sandbox/blob/master/Calibrate_Camera_with_Chessboard/corrected_img.jpg)

Further Instructions coming soon ...
