Use [detect_objects_and_calculate_angle_cv.py](https://github.com/Multi-Access-Edge-Computing-Playground/MEC-Sandbox/blob/master/Detect_Objects_and_Calculate_Angles/detect_objects_and_calculate_angle_cv.py) 
to detect objects while calculating their angle.
This script works best if the camera is located orthogonally above a flat surface with a bright homogenous light source.
The angle and calculated middle point can be used to feed the pose to a robot (pixel coordinates need to be converted to rootic workspace, a function for that is currently developed)
Below image displays the output
