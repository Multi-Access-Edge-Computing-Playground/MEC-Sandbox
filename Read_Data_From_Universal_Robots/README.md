# Read_Data_From_Universal_Robots
Read Data from any Universal Robots via RTDE Interface (see more on RTDE [here](https://www.universal-robots.com/articles/ur/real-time-data-exchange-rtde-guide/)).

Works with all robots (CB>3.4 or e-series).

To receive data from a UR open [read_data_from_universal_robots.py](read_data_from_universal_robots.py) and change `ROBOT_HOST` to the IP of your robot or leave as `localhost` if you use URSim.
Then run the script.
